1. Landing pageÂ is a standalone web page, created for a marketing or advertising campaign, the intent is to focus the visitor and to encourage them to take action. Landing page is designed for conversion. It is different from other pages on our website which is designed to convert visitors into leads and build customers base. 

2. According to me the most important factor of Landing page is its goal. We should be clear about What do we want it to show? What would you like the end result? We should clarify our goals property before making it. Secondly I think Call to Action is important as we want our viewers or users to complete an action like signups or going to home page. Then clarity and colors are important so that they can attract users. 

3.I really liked the Portfolio of Bruno Simon. Its UI is amazing. The idea of showing portfolio through car is wow. Its animations and color scheme are also nice.

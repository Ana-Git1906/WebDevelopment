1.The page we are directed to whenever we click on a a brand’s, product’s, company’s clickable advertisements and search engine optimised results is called a landing page. These pages are created in order to lure the targeted customers to the product and display the abstract details about the brand.
2.I believe the most important aspect of a landing page is the way it presents information. A unique or refreshing design goes a long way in attracting the customers.
3.I rather liked wealthsimple.com because the colors were not daunting, good interface, and its interactive in nature. It’s appropriate for the product it’s trying to sell.

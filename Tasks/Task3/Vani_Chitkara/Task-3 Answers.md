1) A landing page represents a brief introduction to a company's ideology and principles, the work they do and their products and advertisments. 
Landing pages are most often made in accordance with search engine optimization and have a minimalistic design. The landing page contains text 
which is a brief of what their whole brand is, an appealing visual and a few links directing to other pages that contain much more information 
about the products.

2) Accordingly to me, choosing the right color scheme and the colors that are appealing to the eye and easy on them is the most important aspect 
of a landing page

3) Portfolio of Bruno Simon is my favourite website out of all the websites in the section, the color scheme, the animations and the whole idea 
of showing the portfolio through a car journey is simply mind-blowing!!

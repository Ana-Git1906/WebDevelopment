1. A landing page is a standalone web page created specifically for advertising your product . It does not contain any links to navigate through the website
It is the designed for the single goal.

2. according to me, image selection pays a big role in how tour landing page is looking , the quality of image , its goal,  the image should be related
to ypur goal as when we open any webpage our eyes first notices or attracted to the images first then going to the content.

3. I like Wealth Simple among all five because its look soo descent . choice of fonts and colors with the theme is nice and of course animation 
part is also very well organised I like it!!!!.

1. The landing page is the page which is the result of clickable advertisements or search engine optimised results. The objective of the landing page is to satisfy the needs of the users because of which they visited our link.  It includes no links to dive deeper into our product's website but only a call to action to complete the desired need. This page is visually attractive with relevant and catchy images, which interests user's eyes and engages him/her with the desired product.
2. According to me the most important aspect of a landing page is the colors and then the fonts. The colors should be according to the brand the type of work it does. The colors should complements with each other and should be soothing and engaging to the users because its all  about what our eyes want to see next. And the fonts should be clear and readable.
3. The Cellag website is my favourite because of the subtle colors they have used and how smoothly, beautifully every section is displayed.

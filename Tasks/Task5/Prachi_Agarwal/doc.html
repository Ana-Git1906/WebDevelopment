                    <h1>Iron Man: Genius. Billionaire. Philanthropist.</h1>  
                    <p> Tony Stark's confidence is only matched by his high-flying abilities as the hero called Iron Man.Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’ untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation.In a cave in Afghanistan, Tony Stark and Ho Yinsen developed the first Iron Man suit, which Stark used to escape his captors.At the very core of the Iron Man technology lies the Arc Reactor. Designed by Howard Stark, but augmented and strengthened by Tony Stark, the Reactor provides a clean, manageable energy source with incredible output, one that can be adapted to most anything.Iron Man’s armor provided a complete working environment for its user, including enhanced strength, closed air systems, data input, communications, flight, defense systems, and offensive weaponry such as missiles, lasers, and so-called “repulsor” technology.An onboard AI system – originally JARVIS, then replaced by FRIDAY – helps Tony control his armor and connect to other systems. Stark never stops in his advancement of his armor designs, and at one time created multiple versions, each one of them with a specialized use. The armor has also become lighter and more flexible since the first incarnation, allowing Stark to “suit up” in mere seconds and be immediately ready for action.Many of Tony Stark’s enemies have stepped out from the shadows to reveal themselves as people connected to him in some personal way, making for even tougher challenges for Iron Man.Some of Tony Stark’s closest friends, allies, and associates are people he works with.
                        Pepper Potts began as Stark’s personal assistant. She quickly proves her value to him by essentially making sure he survives each day as the owner of Stark IndustriesTony Stark cannot see his life as anything without Pepper Potts, and he hopes to prove it every single day they’re together, through thick and thin.In the Super Hero community, perhaps the closest friend Tony Stark has is Steve Rogers, Captain America.Tony has also found himself serving as a mentor to Peter Parker, the teenage Super Hero known as Spider-Man.Inventor Tony Stark applies his genius for high-tech solutions to problems as Iron Man, the armored Avenger.On the planet Titan, Iron Man, alongside several allies, took on Thanos in a bid to stop the Titan from gaining all of the Infinity Stones.In all he is the greatest superhero, with amazing sense of humour. I love him 3000! </p>

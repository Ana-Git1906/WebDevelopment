               <h1>Ash Ketchum </h1>
               <p>Ash Ketchum is the main protagonist of the Pokémon Anime series. He is eternally a 10-year-old Pokémon 
                   Trainer from Pallet Town in the Kanto region that has always dreamed of becoming the world's greatest Pokémon Master.
                    Being the first human character to be introduced in the series, he is the winner of the Orange League and also the
                     Alola region's Champion, receiving the title after winning its first Pokémon League Conference.

                As soon as he turned 10 years old, Ash rushed to Professor Oak's Laboratory to get his first Pokémon. 
                Originally wanting to choose Squirtle, Ash ended up receiving the Pokémon Pikachu instead, as he arrived late 
                (thus leaving him with no other Starters to choose from). At first, Pikachu did not obey Ash and kept running away, 
                so Ash had to tie him up. After getting chased by a flock of Spearow later in the day thanks to Ash's recklessness,
                 Ash attempted to save Pikachu from them. Seeing that Ash was so determined to help him, Pikachu protected Ash from 
                 the Spearow by electrocuting the entire flock (which was thanks to being struck by lightning at that exact moment and having
                  his Electric-type move supercharged). From then on, Pikachu and Ash became best friends.While Ash was traveling, he was constantly
                   pursued by Team Rocket's Jessie, James, and Meowth, who wanted his Pikachu. They chased him across all the regions so far, and are 
                   still chasing them to this day. Team Rocket never managed to capture Pikachu though, due to Ash's other Pokémon and friends helping 
                   him.
